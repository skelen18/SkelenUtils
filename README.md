## üõ†Ô∏è Git Commands

This section includes the most frequently used Git commands with detailed examples to help you manage your repositories efficiently.

### Basic Git Commands

- **`git init`** ‚Äì Initialize a new Git repository
    - **Example**:  
      If you're starting a new project, navigate to your project folder and run:
      ```bash
      git init
      ```
      This command initializes a new Git repository in the current folder.

- **`git add .`** ‚Äì Stage all changes
    - **Example**:  
      After making changes to your files, run:
      ```bash
      git add .
      ```
      This stages all changes in the directory, preparing them for commit.

- **`git commit -m "message"`** ‚Äì Commit changes with a message
    - **Example**:  
      After staging your changes, commit them with a meaningful message:
      ```bash
      git commit -m "Add new feature"
      ```
      This command commits the staged changes with a description of what was changed.

- **`git push`** ‚Äì Push changes to a remote repository
    - **Example**:  
      To upload your local commits to a remote repository (like GitHub):
      ```bash
      git push origin main
      ```
      This command pushes your commits to the `main` branch of the remote repository.

- **`git pull`** ‚Äì Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository
    - **Example**:  
      To get the latest changes from the remote repository and merge them into your local branch:
      ```bash
      git pull origin main
      ```
      This command fetches changes from the remote `main` branch and merges them into your local `main` branch.

## üíª PowerShell Commands

This section includes useful PowerShell commands to automate tasks, manage files, and interact with your system more efficiently.

### Basic PowerShell Commands

- **`Get-Help <command>`** ‚Äì Get help for any command
    - **Example**:  
      If you're unsure about how to use a specific command, you can get help with:
      ```powershell
      Get-Help Get-Process
      ```
      This will show you all the details about the `Get-Process` command, including its syntax and examples.

- **`Get-Process`** ‚Äì List all running processes
    - **Example**:  
      To list all the running processes on your system, use:
      ```powershell
      Get-Process
      ```
      This will display a list of all the active processes.

- **`Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`** ‚Äì Allow running scripts
    - **Example**:  
      If you want to allow the execution of PowerShell scripts, you can set the execution policy with:
      ```powershell
      Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
      ```
      This command allows you to run locally created scripts but requires remote scripts to be signed.

- **`New-Item <path>`** ‚Äì Create a new file or directory
    - **Example**:  
      To create a new file, you can use:
      ```powershell
      New-Item -Path "C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\NewFile.txt" -ItemType "File"
      ```
      This will create a new file called `NewFile.txt` in the specified location.

### Text Formatting in Discord

- **Bold**: `**text**`  
    - **Example**:  
      To make your text bold, wrap it in double asterisks:
      ```markdown
      **This is bold text**
      ```
      It will appear as: **This is bold text**

- **Italic**: `*text*` or `_text_`  
    - **Example**:  
      To italicize your text, use single asterisks or underscores:
      ```markdown
      *This is italic text*
      ```
      or
      ```markdown
      _This is italic text_
      ```
      It will appear as: *This is italic text* or _This is italic text_

- **Strikethrough**: `~~text~~`  
    - **Example**:  
      To strike through your text, use double tildes:
      ```markdown
      ~~This is strikethrough text~~
      ```
      It will appear as: ~~This is strikethrough text~~

- **Code Block**: `` `code` `` (for inline) or triple backticks for multi-line code blocks  
    - **Example (inline)**:  
      To format inline code, wrap it in single backticks:
      ```markdown
      `const x = 5;`
      ```
      It will appear as: `const x = 5;`

- **Links**: `[Link Text](URL)`  
    - **Example**:  
      To add a clickable link:
      ```markdown
      [Click here](https://example.com)
      ```
      It will appear as: [Click here](https://example.com)
